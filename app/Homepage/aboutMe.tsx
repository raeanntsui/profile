        <div>Hi There! I'm Raeann Tsui. Welcome to my portfolio!</div>
        <div>
          I recently graduated from App Academy, a software engineering
          bootcamp, after pursuing a career in medicine. Transitioning from my
          initial career path as a Physician Assistant (PA) to software
          engineering was driven by my desire for greater flexibility and
          creative expression. While my role as a PA fulfilled my passion for
          problem-solving and direct patient care, I wanted an avenue to explore
          my creativity further. Through extensive research, I discovered that
          software engineering not only aligned with my core values but also
          offered the opportunity for continuous learning and growth. Although I
          no longer engage in face-to-face interactions with patients, I firmly
          believe code bears the same impact to improve the lives of others.
          This belief has fueled my enthusiasm for the transition, despite the
          challenges and uncertainties that lied ahead leaving a profession I
          invested so many financial and time in. Moving forward, I am excited
          to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during my PA training and
          bootcamp training to the professional world of software engineering. I
          see this transition not as a departure from my previous career, but as
          an evolution that allows me to leverage my experiences and expertise
          in new and innovative ways. With an open mind and a dedication to
          lifelong learning, I eagerly anticipate the possibilities that await
          me in this dynamic and ever-changing field.
